# Kallipolis

## About

A harmonious and statically-typed programming language.

## Notes

- "Detached" VM structure ("Virtue VM") which is intentionally upstream
  of core Kal codebase (although it does assume things about ast node structure, 
  i.e., that it offers 'tree' which seems basic but still)
- Typechecking layer! (Proud of this, even though it's kind of a mess.)
